1. Plan the Project Structure
Create a front-end with HTML for layout, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.
Use AWS SDK for JavaScript to interact with AWS APIs.
Securely manage AWS credentials (access and secret keys).
2. Set Up AWS API Integration
Use AWS Cost Explorer or Pricing API to fetch cost details.
Ensure your IAM user or role has the required permissions to access pricing APIs.
Use environment variables or a secure backend to store AWS keys (avoid exposing them in client-side code).
3. Front-End Design
HTML:
Input fields for AWS, region, OS, database type, storage type, and size.
Results section to display the calculated price and markup.
CSS:
Style input fields, buttons, and result boxes.
JavaScript:
Handle user input and API calls.
Perform calculations and display results.
4. API Call Implementation
Use AWS SDK for JS (v3) to call the Pricing API.
Example flow:
Capture user inputs.
Query the API with region, OS, database, and storage details.
Parse the response to extract the base price.
5. Calculation Logic
Calculate the price using the API response.
Apply the 30% markup using JavaScript:
javascript
Copy code
let basePrice = apiResponsePrice;
let markupPrice = basePrice * 1.30;
6. Testing
Test with multiple configurations to ensure accurate calculations.
Handle error cases, e.g., invalid inputs or API failures.
7. Security Considerations
Avoid hardcoding AWS credentials in the client-side code.
Use a server-side application or AWS Cognito to securely manage API keys.
Enable CORS for safe API requests from your frontend.
8. Deployment
Host the website on an AWS service like S3 (static website hosting) or Elastic Beanstalk.
Use HTTPS to secure data transmission.
9. Future Improvements
Add a login feature for user-specific calculations.
Include a dashboard to track historical queries.
Optimize API calls for performance and cost.
